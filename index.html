                        I am a first year graduate student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Statistics track at SUNY Stony Brook. My current 
						coursework include subjects like probability, linear algebra and calculus and data analytics. My interest lies in machine 
						learning and its wide applications in different domains. Before coming to Stony Brook, I've worked in manufacturing and 
						retail sector as a data scientist. I have worked in projects involing predictive analytics (supervised and unsupervised),
						natural language processing and data mining techniques.	I'm a graduate of IIT Kharagpur (Batch of 2015), with a B.Tech-M.Tech
						Dual degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering.

                    Worked for Client, Sears Holdings. Part of a 5 member team that worked directly with Senior Director, Machine Learning. Was
					instrumental in building up gradient boosting models in Python for improving the sales across 80 different business units. The models 
					were further improved by performing feature engineering. Embeddings were created to accommodate the historical buying pattern
					of the customer and fed back to the model. The new improved models increased the sales by ~4%. I had to ensure smooth deployment 
					of the models in the system.

					invasive sensor data. The project was a part of John-Hopkins University. I had to use data mining methods to exploit and understand
					the sensor data. I also used hierarchial clustering to tackle class imbalance problem.

                            As a part of my masters thesis, I decided to explore the applicability of theorical knowledge in a real life situation. I
							examined the assembly line at TATA Bearings, Kharagpur for Inventory and Sustainability analysis (Dow Jones Sustainability Index).
							This topic was of interest to me as TATA, as a company is known to survive the market over decades and it would be interesting to 
							look at one of its vertical critically. I planned to apply Theory of Constraints (TOC) techniques to optimize the inventory 
							replenishment process of spares and consumables. It came to my understanding that these raw materials were least optimized over the line
							for they were mostly ordered in bulk and hence also consumed a lot of inventory space. I primarily used Holt-Winters model to improve 
							throughput of the inventory management system. By the end of my study I could suggest improvements with the help of my professor and the line 
							mananger to reduce the in-hand inventory by ~3%.

                            As a part of my bachelors thesis, I decided to explore genetic algorithms beyond a black box. I implemented a research paper
							with suitable tweaking to suit the needs of my defined problem. I implemented it to solve the well documented problem of
							job shop scheduling. I used MATLAB to code the algorithm. I also did a time and space complexity analysis of the code and 
							suggested a few improvements while defending my thesis.
